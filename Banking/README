This is a simple banking program that is made with python. In this case, it requires the 'record.txt' file
in order for it to edit and keep track of previous transactions and balances.

This program is made so that I can easily keep track of how my income fairs agains't the expenese that I have.
It's very simple to use and allows for quick updates to be made to the finances and you can see the balance after each
transaction, be it a deposit or a withdrawl. 

This was made through VSCODE and the code will need some alteration to use as the path to the 'record.txt' file isn't the same
as when I had initially made the program.
